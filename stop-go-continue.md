###Stop comments üôÖüèª

- Discard Hapi? A lot of people prefer Express and it's used much more often. Some people think Hapi is higher lever framework but more difficult to learn because the documentation isn't well written and all the tutorials out there use express.
- 16 man project was fun but the learning curve was too high. Vote was taken to turn this into 2, 8 person projects.
- React, one week workshops, one week project with 8 + 8 person teams. Vote 1 person to keep 16 p project, rest for 8 + 8, one abstain.
- Qunit testing framework to be scrapped. Testing possibly to be moved later in the course. Introducing testing earlier might help understanding it later. Arguments for teaching testing for specific tasks.
- Possibilty of ditching redis and starting mongoDB instead. Mongo is used more often but might be too close to postgres. Usecases for Redis? Maybe only teach postgres and teach the concept of databases. Vote: Keeping things how they are 2, swopping to mongo 4, only teaching postgres 6. Dan says learning SQL will be important and is in favor of just postgres. 
- Stop handlebars? With React there is overlapping. Sam thinks it's good to introduce many subjects. Vote to keep 3, kill handlebars 10.
- Drop raw http server writing. Important to understand but not good to repeat. Introducing hapi earlier? Mattia thinks it's good to do it at least once and understand it's javascript better. Better resources introduced as pre-course material. Changing Node into one week of node and one week of hapi by unanimous vote. 
- Ditch react? Dan thinks it might be just a fleeting trend. Not introducing Redux was a bad decision. Maybe give heads up before course about react. Spending more time teaching react. Week of react and week of project.

- Jakub wants to start earlier. Start at ten regardless of who is here. Arribe at 9:45 start at 10. Bridging to code of conduct. 
- Homework, have a OPTIONAL list of resources to do as "homework". 
- More DOM manipulation first week, Free code camp and udacity javascript. 
- Peer mentorship, everyone has a person from fac 8 to contact to talk about stuff or course, not technical support. Buddy system. Helpdesk channel for people to contact if they need help. 
- CSS. Emphasis on first week. Straight to flexbox. Semantic html. More precourse css and emphasis troughout. More morning challenges for css. Monday-weds, workshops
- More workshops on monday and tues in morning  challenge format.
- ES6 as precourse. 
- Crafts day!! Posters on wall for git flow etc. Rory will reseach.
- Little library for fac.
-  No readmes? More tutorials or practical ways to learn the subjects. More peer pressure to present/question. Readmes are not good source for information. Presentation with slides. Find favourite resource and present that. Screencast or presentation or quiz. 
-  Redux, Flux etc. needs to be introduced amongst react. Some people want to teach React+redux together from start. 
- code of conduct & better induction in gitbook on first day. Working together. Pairprogramming, turn up in time. Assign the first day to a team.
- codereviewing. Present before codereviews. Presenting codereviews. Snap the whip. Be more strict.
- Free code camp as a pre course material to get everyone up to speed. Task, precourse material. 
- more alumni talks + workshop. task, two people to email alumni
- Evening workshops from alumni.

- Readme question time. Continue and peer pressure helps.
- We like Jasmine.
- Learning outcomes. Aligned with improving gitbook. 
- Office hours. Nice to have set hours when to ask questions. Possibly use alumni for office hours too. Less pressure for people who do know subjects more in depth. Nicer for beginners to ask from more experienced folk. Thursday afternoon?
- "Not finishing project" stress. Matt likes stress.
