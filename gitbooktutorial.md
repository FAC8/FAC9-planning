#How to use GitBook


**GitBook is awful to use but nice to read. This tutorial will hopefully make it less painful for future cohorts.**

##Creating a GitBook for the next cohort.

At least one person from your cohort needs to have admin rights to the repo you clone the gitbook into on the founders and coders organisation on github in order to create a GitBook from an existing repository.

On GitBook it won't allow you to create a GitBook from a FAC repository unless you are invited to the Founders & Coders organisation on gitbook and have admin rights on the gitbook organisation as well.

Once you have the right privileges here are the steps you need to follow:

1) Find the latest GitBook on the Founders & Coders organisation on gitbook and clone it to your computer locally.

2) Create a repository in the relevant organisation with this clone.

3) On gitbook create a new GitBook from that clone. You will need to select the option to import from Github and then select the cloned repository.

4) Start editing the book!

##Creating a file on the GitBook

Next you want to create some new files. "That's easy!" I hear you say, but no. GitBook has made this very simple sounding task as annoying as possible.

1) When you select the option to edit a gitbook, there are two file directories you can see. On top is the one that is displayed in the book and below are the actual .md from the repository that you created your book from.

2) Create a new file under the appropriate folder on the bottom directory by right clicking the folder and selecting "new file".

3) Then on the top, right click on the folder you want that file displayed in and create an article with the name that you want to have displayed under that week. "Learning outcomes" for example.

4) And now you need to *link* these two files together. Right click the article you just created and select "Edit pointing file". Point that to the .md file you want to link it to.

5) Great success.

Note: the files that you see in gitbook's editing mode are in sync with those in the repo the gitbook was created from and will update them automatically. Vice versa if you update the repo.
